UglifyCSS is the translation of [YUI Compressor](https://github.com/yui/yuicompressor), for its CSS part, from Java to [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org). Its name is a reference to the awesome [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) but UglifyCSS is not a CSS parser. Like YUI CSS Compressor, It applies many replacements using regex.

Usage: `uglifycss css1 [css2] [...] > output`
